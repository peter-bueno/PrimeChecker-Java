# Prime Number Checker

This project is a **Java** algorithm that prompts the user for an integer and checks whether it is a prime number.

## ðŸ“œ Description

- The program receives a number entered by the user.  
- It applies an efficient method based on the square root to check if the number is prime.  
- Displays the result indicating whether the number is prime or not.  

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Java** (version 8+)  
- **Scanner** for user input  
- **Math.sqrt()** for optimized prime number verification  

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/peter-bueno/PrimeChecker-Java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd PrimeChecker-Java
   ```
3. Compile and run the program:
   ```sh
   javac Ex6.java
   java Ex6
   ```
4. Enter an integer when prompted and check if it's prime!  

## âœ¨ Future Improvements

- Allow checking multiple numbers in sequence.  
- Implement a graphical user interface version.  
- Performance optimizations for larger numbers.
